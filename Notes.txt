The terms **API** (Application Programming Interface) and **Web Service** are often used interchangeably, but they have distinct meanings and functions,
even though they may overlap in practice. Here’s a detailed comparison:

### 1. **Definition:**

- **API**:
  - An **API** is a set of rules that allows one piece of software to interact with another.
  - It provides a way to request data or functionality from another application or system.
  - APIs can be used over various communication protocols, including HTTP, TCP, etc.

- **Web Service**:
  - A **Web Service** is a specific kind of API that operates over the web (HTTP) and is designed for machine-to-machine interaction.
  - It is a network-accessible API that adheres to specific standards, often involving XML, JSON, or similar formats.

### 2. **Communication Protocols:**

- **API**:
  - Can use various protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, WebSockets, FTP, or even direct libraries for inter-process communication.
  
- **Web Service**:
  - Typically operates over HTTP or HTTPS.
  - Examples of web service protocols include **SOAP** (which uses XML) and **REST** (which often uses JSON).

### 3. **Types:**

- **API**:
  - **REST API**: Uses standard HTTP methods and URL patterns to interact with resources (typically stateless).
  - **GraphQL API**: A query language for APIs that allows clients to request specific data.
  - **Library-based APIs**: Communication happens within the same application using function calls (e.g., Java or Python libraries).
  
- **Web Service**:
  - **SOAP Web Service**: Uses SOAP protocol, which is XML-based and has strict standards for request and response formatting.
  - **RESTful Web Service**: Uses REST principles, generally lighter and less strict than SOAP, with data often exchanged in JSON or XML.
  
### 4. **Architecture Style:**

- **API**:
  - Broader in scope; could be **local** (within the same system), **remote**, or **web-based**.
  
- **Web Service**:
  - A specific kind of API that is always remote and accessed over the network (via the web).

### 5. **Statefulness:**

- **API**:
  - Can be **stateless** (e.g., most REST APIs) or **stateful** (e.g., some library-based APIs where the state is maintained).
  
- **Web Service**:
  - Generally, **SOAP Web Services** can maintain a state, whereas **RESTful Web Services** are **stateless**.

### 6. **Usage:**

- **API**:
  - Used in a wide variety of contexts beyond just web services. Examples include:
    - **Operating System APIs**: Interact with OS features (e.g., Windows API).
    - **Library APIs**: To interact with a third-party library within the same application (e.g., TensorFlow API).
    - **Database APIs**: Used for database interactions.
  
- **Web Service**:
  - Used for network-based interactions, typically over the internet. Example use cases:
    - Interactions between cloud-based systems.
    - Service-oriented architecture (SOA) for enterprise-level applications.

### 7. **Examples:**

- **API**:
  - Google Maps API (used to embed maps in applications).
  - Twitter API (used to fetch or post tweets programmatically).
  - Windows API (used to interact with the Windows OS).
  
- **Web Service**:
  - SOAP-based web services, often used in enterprise applications (e.g., for secure transactions in banking).
  - RESTful web services, such as those used by companies like GitHub, Twitter, or OpenWeatherMap to expose their data over the web.

### 8. **Performance:**

- **API**:
  - Performance depends on the specific type of API and the underlying technology.
  - For example, local APIs (within the same system) tend to have faster response times compared to network-based APIs.
  
- **Web Service**:
  - Web services tend to be slower than local APIs due to the overhead of network communication and data exchange over the web.

### 9. **Security:**

- **API**:
  - Security mechanisms can vary depending on the type of API. Common security mechanisms include API keys, OAuth, or JWT for token-based security.
  
- **Web Service**:
  - SOAP Web Services provide built-in standards for security (e.g., WS-Security for message encryption and authentication).
  - RESTful web services commonly use HTTPS and OAuth for secure communication and user authentication.

### Summary:

| **Feature**            | **API**                              | **Web Service**                   |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Definition**          | Interface to allow communication between different software applications | A specific type of API accessible over the web |
| **Protocols**           | Can use multiple protocols (HTTP, TCP, etc.) | Primarily uses HTTP/HTTPS |
| **Data Format**         | JSON, XML, plain text, binary, etc.  | Typically XML (SOAP) or JSON (REST) |
| **Use Case**            | Broader use cases (local or remote)  | Always network-based, typically remote |
| **Statefulness**        | May be stateful or stateless         | Stateless (REST), Stateful (SOAP) |
| **Examples**            | Twitter API, Google Maps API         | SOAP Web Service, RESTful Web Services |

### In Conclusion:
- **APIs** are a broad concept that encompasses any way two pieces of software communicate, while **Web Services** are a specific subset of APIs that function over the web and follow particular protocols.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

API Vs Web Service, API which is not a webservice :


An **API that is not a Web Service** refers to an Application Programming Interface that does not rely on communication over the web (HTTP/HTTPS). APIs can exist within an application, between local software components, or even across different machines without using web protocols.

Here are some examples of APIs that are not web services:

### 1. **Operating System APIs**:
Operating systems like Windows, Linux, and macOS provide APIs to allow applications to interact with system resources like files, memory, hardware, and processes.

- **Example**: 
  - **Windows API** (WinAPI): It allows applications to interact with the Windows OS, accessing things like file systems, windows management, networking, and device control.
  - **POSIX API**: A set of standards for Unix-like operating systems that enables application developers to write programs that can interact with the OS's kernel.

### 2. **Library/API within the Same Application**:
Many APIs are used to interact with libraries or frameworks within the same application, where communication happens via direct function calls, not over a network.

- **Example**: 
  - **Java API**: Allows programs to call methods and classes within the Java Standard Library to perform tasks like file handling, database access, and threading without any network communication.
  - **TensorFlow API**: A machine learning library that offers APIs in Python or C++ to build and execute models within the same environment, without requiring any web communication.

### 3. **Database APIs**:
APIs that interact directly with a database, often through a driver, without using web services or HTTP. These APIs are typically designed to work with specific database management systems (DBMS).

- **Example**:
  - **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**: Allows Java applications to communicate with databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL directly, without needing web-based communication.
  - **ODBC (Open Database Connectivity)**: A standard API for accessing database management systems in a language-independent manner.

### 4. **Hardware APIs**:
Hardware vendors provide APIs that allow software to interact with the hardware without requiring web services.

- **Example**:
  - **DirectX API**: A collection of APIs for handling tasks related to multimedia, especially game programming and video, on Microsoft platforms. It interacts directly with the GPU and other hardware components.
  - **OpenGL**: A cross-platform API for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics directly interacting with the graphics hardware.


### Summary:
While **Web Services** are a type of **API** that operates over the internet (HTTP/HTTPS),
many **APIs** do not involve web communication. These APIs facilitate communication between software components, libraries, hardware, or databases locally or over non-web-based protocols.

XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a markup language used to encode documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. It was designed to store and transport data, making it a widely used format for exchanging data over the internet. Some key features of XML include:

1. **Self-descriptive**: XML tags provide information about the data itself.
2. **Hierarchical Structure**: Data is organized in a tree-like structure using elements (tags).
3. **Platform-Independent**: XML is plain text, so it can be read and written by various systems and programming languages.
4. **Custom Tags**: Unlike HTML, XML allows users to define their own tags, making it flexible for different types of data.

A simple XML example:

```xml
<bookstore>
  <book>
    <title lang="en">The Great Gatsby</title>
    <author>F. Scott Fitzgerald</author>
    <year>1925</year>
  </book>
</bookstore>
```

Common use cases of XML include:
- Data interchange between systems (e.g., web services like SOAP).
- Configuration files (e.g., for software applications).
- RSS feeds for content syndication.
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


JSON

**JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. Despite its name, JSON is language-independent and is used extensively beyond JavaScript. It is commonly used to transmit data between a server and a client in web applications and APIs.

### Key Features of JSON:
1. **Human-Readable**: JSON uses a simple syntax that’s easy for humans to understand.
2. **Lightweight**: It has minimal overhead, making it efficient for data exchange over networks.
3. **Language Independent**: Although it was originally based on JavaScript, JSON can be used in many other programming languages such as Python, Java, C#, and more.
4. **Self-Descriptive**: Similar to XML, JSON data is organized in a way that describes the structure and data being transferred.
5. **Data Types**: JSON supports basic data types like strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects.

### JSON Syntax:
JSON represents data as **key-value pairs**, where keys are always strings, and values can be various data types.

#### Example of JSON Structure:
```json
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "age": 30,
  "isStudent": false,
  "courses": ["Math", "Science"],
  "address": {
    "street": "123 Main St",
    "city": "Anytown"
  }
}
```

### Key Components of JSON:

1. **Objects**:
   - Represented by curly braces `{}`.
   - Contain key-value pairs, where each key is a string, and the value can be a string, number, boolean, array, or another object.
   - Example:
     ```json
     {
       "name": "Alice",
       "age": 30
     }
     ```

2. **Arrays**:
   - Represented by square brackets `[]`.
   - Contain a list of values, which can be strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, or objects.
   - Example:
     ```json
     {
       "courses": ["Math", "Science", "History"]
     }
     ```

3. **Strings**:
   - Represented by double quotes around text.
   - Example: `"Hello World"`

4. **Numbers**:
   - Can be integers or floating-point numbers.
   - Example: `25`, `3.14`

5. **Booleans**:
   - Represent `true` or `false`.
   - Example: `true`, `false`

6. **Null**:
   - Represents a null value.
   - Example: `null`

### JSON vs XML:
While both JSON and XML are used for data exchange, JSON has become more popular due to its simplicity and efficiency. Here's a brief comparison:

| **Feature**           | **JSON**                               | **XML**                                |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Readability**        | Simple and concise                     | More verbose, uses closing tags        |
| **Data Type Support**  | Supports strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects | Typically uses strings, attributes for data types |
| **Parsing Speed**      | Faster and easier to parse             | Slower and more complex to parse       |
| **Syntax Overhead**    | Lightweight with minimal syntax        | Heavier due to opening/closing tags    |
| **Use of Attributes**  | No attribute concept (only key-value pairs) | Attributes and elements for data      |
| **Usage**              | Common in modern web applications and APIs | Common in legacy systems and document-centric data |

### Example: JSON in a REST API:
In a REST API, data is typically exchanged in JSON format. Here’s an example of a simple request and response in JSON:

**Request:**
```json
POST /api/users
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "age": 28
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "userId": 101,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "age": 28,
  "status": "created"
}
```

### Use Cases of JSON:
1. **Data Exchange**: Commonly used for exchanging data between a server and a client in web applications.
2. **Configuration Files**: JSON is often used to store configuration data in applications (e.g., `.json` files in JavaScript-based projects).
3. **Storing Simple Data**: Many databases, like MongoDB, use JSON-like documents to store data.
4. **Serialization**: JSON is widely used to serialize and deserialize objects when transferring data between different systems.

### JSON Tools and Libraries:
- **JSON Parser**: Many programming languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java, PHP) provide built-in libraries to parse and generate JSON data.
- **Example in Python**:
  ```python
  import json

  # Parsing JSON string
  json_data = '{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}'
  parsed_data = json.loads(json_data)
  print(parsed_data["name"])  # Output: Alice

  # Creating JSON from a dictionary
  data = {"name": "Bob", "age": 25}
  json_string = json.dumps(data)
  print(json_string)  # Output: {"name": "Bob", "age": 25}
  ```

JSON has become the de facto standard for web APIs and data interchange due to its simplicity, readability, and compatibility with modern programming environments. Would you like to dive into a specific JSON use case or implementation?

PUT VS PATCH 


Both **PUT** and **PATCH** are HTTP methods used in web APIs (especially RESTful APIs) to update resources, but they work in different ways. Here's a comparison of the two:

### 1. **PUT**:
- **Purpose**: Replaces the entire resource with the new data provided. If a resource already exists at the given URL, it is updated. If it doesn't exist, a new resource may be created depending on the API design.
- **Idempotent**: Repeatedly calling PUT with the same data results in the same resource state. If you send the same PUT request multiple times, the result will always be the same.
- **Request Body**: Must contain the complete representation of the resource. All fields must be included, even if only some are being updated.
  
**Example of a PUT Request**:
```http
PUT /users/123
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "age": 30
}
```
If this request is sent, the entire user resource (ID 123) is updated with the data provided. All fields (`name`, `email`, `age`) must be included, even if only the name or email is being changed.

### 2. **PATCH**:
- **Purpose**: Partially updates a resource. Only the fields provided in the request are modified, and other fields remain unchanged.
- **Not Necessarily Idempotent**: PATCH is not strictly idempotent because applying a PATCH request with partial updates may have different effects based on previous updates, depending on the API design.
- **Request Body**: Contains only the fields that need to be updated.

**Example of a PATCH Request**:
```http
PATCH /users/123
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "newemail@example.com"
}
```
In this case, only the `email` field is updated, while other fields like `name` and `age` remain unchanged.

### Key Differences Between PUT and PATCH:

| **Feature**              | **PUT**                                                | **PATCH**                                             |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Update Type**           | Replaces the entire resource                           | Partially updates the resource                        |
| **Idempotency**           | Idempotent (repeating the request has the same effect) | Not necessarily idempotent (depends on the resource)  |
| **Required Data**         | Complete representation of the resource                | Only the data fields that need to be updated          |
| **Common Use Case**       | When the client has the entire resource and wants to update or replace it | When only specific fields need to be modified         |
| **Data Integrity**        | The entire resource needs to be sent, ensuring consistency | Only the required changes are sent, which can be more efficient |

### When to Use PUT:
- Use PUT when you want to update or replace the entire resource.
- Example: Modifying the details of a user profile where all the data is known.

### When to Use PATCH:
- Use PATCH when you want to partially update a resource.
- Example: Updating a user's email address without changing their name or other attributes.

### Summary:

- **PUT**: Used to replace an entire resource. If a field is missing, it might be deleted or reset based on the API's behavior.
- **PATCH**: Used to partially modify a resource, leaving other fields unchanged. It's more efficient when only certain fields need updating.

Status Codes 

Here are common HTTP status codes with concise descriptions:

### **1xx: Informational**
- **100 Continue**: Server received request headers, client should proceed.
- **101 Switching Protocols**: Server switches protocols as requested by the client.

### **2xx: Success**
- **200 OK**: Request succeeded.
- **201 Created**: Resource successfully created.
- **202 Accepted**: Request accepted, but processing not completed.
- **204 No Content**: Request successful, but no content returned.

### **3xx: Redirection**
- **301 Moved Permanently**: Resource has been moved permanently.
- **302 Found**: Resource temporarily located at a different URI.
- **304 Not Modified**: Cached version of the resource is still valid.

### **4xx: Client Errors**
- **400 Bad Request**: The request is malformed or invalid.
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication required.
- **403 Forbidden**: Server refuses to fulfill the request.
- **404 Not Found**: Requested resource not found.
- **405 Method Not Allowed**: HTTP method not supported for the resource.
- **408 Request Timeout**: Server timed out waiting for the request.

### **5xx: Server Errors**
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Generic server error.
- **502 Bad Gateway**: Invalid response from upstream server.
- **503 Service Unavailable**: Server is temporarily unavailable.
- **504 Gateway Timeout**: Server didn’t receive a timely response from the upstream server.

These codes are used by web servers to communicate the status of HTTP requests.




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scripts for Get/1 request

pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
    pm.response.to.have.status(200);
});

pm.test("Response time is good",function(){
pm.expect(pm.response.responseTime).to.below(3000);
});


pm.test("Correct Student First Name",function(){
    var jsondata=pm.response.json();
    pm.expect(jsondata.firstname).to.eql("Pearlie");
});

pm.test("Correct Student Last Name",function(){
    var jsondata=pm.response.json();
    pm.expect(jsondata.lastname).to.eql("Becker");
});

URL VS URI

Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) and a Uniform Resource Location (URL)

Both URIs and URLs are pointers to things like web pages, images, documents, or other online content.


https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-url-and-uri/


url ex: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-cost-graph

What is URL (Uniform Resource Locator)? 
URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is often defined as a string of characters that is directed to an address. It provides a way to retrieve the presentation of the physical location by describing its network location or primary access mechanism. 

To locate a resource on the internet, use a Uniform Resource Locator or URL. It serves as both a resource reference and an access point. A unique resource—which could be an image, an HTML page, a CSS document, or anything else—is always displayed by a URL.


What is URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)?
Similar to URL, URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) is also a string of characters that identifies a resource on the web either by using location, name or both.
It allows uniform identification of the resources. A URI is additionally grouped as a locator, a name or both which suggests it can describe a URL, URN or both.
The term identifier within the URI refers to the prominence of the resources, despite the technique used. 



Difference Between URL and URI

URL
URI

URL is used to describe the identity of an item.
URI provides a technique for defining the identity of an item.


URL links a web page, a component of a web page or a program on a web page with the help of accessing methods like protocols.
URI is used to distinguish one resource from other regardless of the method used.

URL provides the details about what type of protocol is to be used.
URI doesn’t contains the protocol specification.

URL is a type of URI.
URI is the superset of URL.

It comprises of protocol, domain, path, hash, and so on.
It comprises of scheme, authority, path, query and many more.
